# Team Edge Lab 11 - 2

For this activity, you should work with a partner.

This website could use some help. It's not that it is ugly, it simply lacks style.
Think of it as a blank slate for you to try the following:

1. Select fonts that work well together. Don't use too many.
2. Apply your understanding of color theory
3. Fix the alignment and spacing of the elements. including ine-height and width.
4. Create more <divs> as needed to wrap elements and apply styles to them.
5. Use the provided spans as needed.
6. Add more pictures if needed
7. Try a new layout

Work in the style.css to make this page SING!!!
